# ECON-T studies

This repository is a collection of tools used for visualizing and analyzing simulated data for the development of the ECON-T FE ASIC.  The code contained within is useful for,

   * converting simulated datasets from ROOT files into dataframes or numpy arrays
   * analyzing and visualizing trigger cell data
   * transforming data into formats more suitable for training NN
   * defining NN architectures
   * carrying out training
   * producing performance metrics
